# Angular Data Binding Example

This Angular project serves as a simple demonstration of data binding in Angular.

## What is Data Binding?

Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between the model (or data source) and the view (UI). In Angular, there are four types of data binding:

1. **Interpolation:** This is a one-way data binding from the component to the view. It uses double curly braces `{{ }}` to bind component data to an HTML element.

2. **Property Binding:** Also known as one-way binding from the component to the view. It binds an element property to a component property using square brackets `[]`.

3. **Event Binding:** This is one-way binding from the view to the component. It allows you to listen to events such as click, mouseover, etc., and trigger methods in the component class using parentheses `()`.

4. **Two-Way Binding:** This is a combination of property binding and event binding. It allows data to flow both from the component to the view and from the view to the component. It uses the `[(ngModel)]` directive for two-way binding.
